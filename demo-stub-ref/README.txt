Note: source codebase has yet to be switched to Unicode, it's on the to-do list, right now there's *some* uglyness left and right because of it.

These files are a part of both the TPBDS mark III (demosystem) player stub and many Windows & DirectX 11.0 based commercial projects.
TPBDS mark III is a project by Superplek (Niels J. de Wit) & Glow (Thijs Kruithof).

It's intent is to serve as a reference on how to correctly handle a modern DirectX-based Windows demo,
or whatever else kind of audiovisual software.

It won't compile nor is directly usable in it's current form.
The entire engine will be released eventually.

Disclaimer: in development, I'm updating on a regular basis, but expect a bug or two.
Or even better: tell me what I'm doing wrong and why.

Feel free to e-mail (ndewit@gmail.com).

Cheers,
- Niels, otherwise known as Superplek/Bypass
