NOTE: switching this codebase to Unicode is on the to-do list, right now there's some uglyness left and right because it hasn't been done yet.

These are a few files part of the TPBDS mark 3 player stub.
TPBDS mark 3 is a demosystem by Superplek (Niels J. de Wit) & Glow (Thijs Kruithof).

It's intent is to serve as a reference on how to correctly handle a DirectX-based Windows demo,
or whatever else kind of audiovisual software. 

It won't compile nor is directly usable in it's current form.

Releasing the entire engine might happen some day but as it's not just my decision to make this will have to do for now.

Disclaimer: this is still very much in development, so expect a bug or two. I will try to update these files every now and then.


Cheers,
- Niels/Superplek
