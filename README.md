# Stuff that's not really a project yet I felt was worth the disk space.

- udprelay: Piece of prototype for Linux daemon that tunnels multicast UDP streams to TCP which was a stopgap fix for Windows digital broadcating software.
- Shadertoy backup: a bunch more and less inspired graphical effects (raymarching, 2D, post-processing et ceera)
- TPBDS stub: decent (though a bit dated) Win32 stub code for a demoscene framework (because a lot of demoscene releases still do that part poorly)
- GLSL + three.js: at some point this was my company website, I might do it again :-)
- aspectratios.h - A long while ago I did sort of a deep dive (Wikipedia) into aspect ratios (how very James May of me).
